|-------|-------|---------|----------|--------|
| 1 | 500 | $5,000 | $3,000 | $2,000 |

## KEY METRICS TO TRACK

### Growth Metrics
- Daily Active Users (DAU)
- Retention Day 1/7/30
- Cost Per Acquisition (CPA)
- Lifetime Value (LTV)

### Revenue Metrics
- Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)
- Conversion rate (free to paying)
- Skin sell-through rate
- Combo NFT volume

### Engagement Metrics
- Matches per user per day
- Average match duration
- Combo length distribution
- Spectator to player ratio

## WHAT I SHOULD BUILD NOW

Based on revenue potential, priority order:

1. **Unity WebGL Port** - Without playable game, nothing else matters
2. **Solana Payment Integration** - Real money, not just demo
3. **Skin System** - Highest margin, easiest to implement
4. **Combo Recording UI** - Unique blockchain feature
5. **Matchmaking** - Keeps players playing

## CONCERNS TO ADDRESS

### Technical
- WebGL performance with rollback netcode
- Solana transaction speed for in-game purchases
- Anti-cheat for ranked matches

### Market
- Competition from established fighting games
- Learning curve for new IP
- Crypto market volatility

### Legal
- Gambling regulations for betting
- SEC considerations for tokenized assets
- Age verification requirements

## FINAL ADVICE

Start small, launch fast, iterate based on data.

Don't build:
- 10 characters (launch with 2)
- 50 stages (launch with 3)
- Full tournament system (start with weekly cups)

Do build:
- Playable game ASAP
- Clean payment flow
- Social features (sharing, replays)
- Clear progression (battle pass)

The engine is solid. The blockchain feature is unique. 
Now we need players and a path to their wallets.
